  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hello, I'm <b>Ruohan</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Mechatronic Engineering at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China, under the supervision of Prof. Geng Yang.
  </p>

  <p>
    Currently, I am exploring <b>exoskeleton-based teleoperation</b> to enhance 
    the safety and intuitiveness of assistive robots in homecare.

  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <h3>Teleoperation with Exoskeleton</h3>
  <p>
    A shared-control framework for teleoperating assistive robots in homecare scenarios. 
    This project integrates a wearable exoskeleton with force feedback to ensure 
    safety and intuitiveness in physical human-robot interaction.
  </p>

  <h3>Dual-arm Task-adaptive Grasping</h3>
  <p>
    Design and control of an anthropomorphic dual-arm robot capable of 
    adaptive grasping and manipulation in unstructured environments. 
    The system integrates vision-based recognition and dynamic task planning.
  </p>

  <h3>Vision-based Caregiving Assistance</h3>
  <p>
    A vision-guided robotic assistant capable of recognizing medical devices 
    and supporting patients with limited mobility.
